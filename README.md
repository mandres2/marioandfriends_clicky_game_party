## Code Explanation:

## How To Use The Application:

1. The anatomy of the application is depicted as the following:

   d. .gitignore (ignores the node_modules folder when conducting the add, commit and push commands)
   e. LICENSE - standard license under the MIT
   f. package-lock/package.json contain the downloaded npm dependencies utilized for this application.
